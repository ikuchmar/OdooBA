Intro
0:00
hi and welcome back to your doers in our
0:01
last tutorial we have seen the basic
0:03
accounts and the configuration of the
0:05
chart of accounts to go further let's
0:07
now check out together the tips and
0:09
tricks on how to update your chart of
0:11
accounts when you set up your accounting
0:13
for the first time
0:15
this video will recommend suitable
0:17
approaches by showing you how to update
0:20
all accounts effortlessly in batches
0:22
through a spreadsheet import let's now
0:24
jump in the database to see how to do
0:26
that
0:27
so here we are in our database for my
Update chart of accounts
0:30
ping cars company and what i need to do
0:32
to make my accounting uh configurations
0:34
ready is first to update my chart of
0:36
accounts so i'm what i'm going to do is
0:38
go in the configuration of the
0:39
accounting app and check for my chart of
0:42
accounts menu so instead of here
0:44
manually updating account by account
0:46
what i want to do is select the whole
0:49
list select all 400 accounts and export
0:52
it into a spreadsheet so i'm going to
0:54
click on export here you see that audio
0:57
already gives me some fields to export
0:59
what i want to add in addition is to
1:01
select the i want to update data feature
1:04
this feature enables us then afterwards
1:06
when you import to make sure that you
1:08
update the right records and not adding
1:11
new ones what i'm going to add as well
1:13
is the deprecated field here
1:16
because we're going to need it when we
1:17
want to update the chart of accounts and
1:19
i'm just going to export
1:21
once this is done we're going to open it
Important information
1:23
and see what happens behind that so what
1:25
you see in the first column is what we
1:27
call the external id so it's something
1:30
that's really important it's really
1:31
important concept you do because it's a
1:34
unique code for any information in your
1:36
database so it's for for your chart of
1:38
accounts for your contacts for for
1:40
anything in the system and when you
1:42
update through an import you need this
1:45
information to make sure that you update
1:47
the right information in the system so
1:50
color the column to make sure that you
1:52
don't update it another important
1:54
information that you should not change
1:56
easily is the account type remember
1:58
we've talked about it um it's a very
2:01
important concept in udu and um you
2:04
should not update for
2:05
the account type for existing accounts
2:07
only for new ones that you're going to
2:08
add
2:10
so let's say here now that you want to
2:12
update the account so what i always say
2:14
is don't create a whole chart of
2:16
accounts update the existing one so what
2:19
you for example let's say i have an
2:21
account here
2:22
in fixed assets
2:23
here my furniture and vehicles account i
2:25
don't like how it's named so i'm just
2:27
going to change the name
2:29
and instead of vehicles i'm just going
2:30
to put cars so super easy
2:33
you can change the names to whatever you
2:35
like there is no restriction here what
2:37
is important is when you want to change
2:39
the account code instead depending on
2:42
your country's accounting principles you
2:45
you have more or less restrictions so
2:47
for example in belgium or france for
2:50
example
2:51
the account code is really important
2:53
when you want to split the accounts into
2:55
the financial report so this is what
2:57
gives us
2:58
the balance sheet and the profit and
3:00
loss statement so here i can change it
3:02
but only to a certain extent so always
3:04
keep the first two digits intact and
3:07
change the rest of it if you like no
3:09
restrictions for that
3:11
for other countries like the uk or the
3:13
u.s for example the account code is not
3:16
really important for for the financial
3:17
reports it's only the account type that
3:20
counts so you don't have any
3:22
restrictions in that case so make sure
3:24
that you know your country's
3:26
accounting criteria before updating your
3:28
chart of accounts
3:29
now if you want to add a new account
3:31
super easy you just go at the bottom of
3:33
the page and you add a new one to the
3:37
list basically so here in that case
3:39
you can just let's say i want a new
3:42
expense account
3:44
mix expenses for example
3:46
here you have to put an account type
3:48
because it's an account that doesn't
3:50
exist yet so if you have doubts on which
3:53
account type to choose from
3:55
you just take the closest existing
3:57
account to the one that you want to
3:59
create and you just stick to the same
4:01
configuration so here i'm just going to
4:03
put expenses and that's basically it
4:05
okay
4:07
here you don't need to put an external
4:09
id
4:10
if you don't put one it's just going to
4:12
create a new account and it will assign
4:14
an external id on its own but if you
4:16
want to you can always put here account
4:20
oops here a few mistake accounts
4:25
i'm just going to put my trigram and a
4:28
sequence here to make sure that i have a
4:30
unique code in my external id
4:33
is that all clear for you kiara yeah it
4:35
sounds great so does it mean i can
4:37
delete uh some accounts that i don't use
4:40
no actually no it's not really a good
4:42
idea because when you update a chart of
4:44
accounts and there are of course some
4:46
accounts that you're never going to use
4:48
um it's better to deprecate them so
4:50
deprecated in a do means archives
4:52
basically so they still exist but you
4:55
can't choose them when you are creating
4:57
accounting entries why is it important
4:59
because uh you know do there are a lot
5:01
of default configuration default
5:03
accounts that we use uh like for example
5:05
the receivable accounts it's always the
5:07
same one when uh that is a sign phone
5:09
will create a new contact so it's really
5:11
important that you don't delete those by
5:14
mistake because afterwards you're gonna
5:16
get error messages uh what's also
5:18
important here and i don't know if
5:19
you've noticed uh
5:21
in in the system is that you have uh
5:24
what we call a current
5:26
current here earnings account here this
5:29
account type here what's really
5:30
important is that you always keep one
5:33
account like this you can't change it
5:34
it's audio specific so basically it
5:36
enables us to give
5:38
the total benefit or loss of the year in
5:40
your p l statement so just remember that
5:42
you can only keep one and you should not
5:44
deprecate it and you should not delete
5:46
it okay
5:47
um well we've done all our all our
5:50
updates so i'm just going to save
5:52
the updates in in my file i'm going to
5:54
go back into the database and update it
Import
5:57
uh updated through an import so when you
5:59
want to update afterwards you just go in
6:02
the favorites section and this is valid
6:03
for any view in the system
6:05
and import the records here i'm going to
6:08
upload my file and i'm going to choose
6:10
here my
6:13
my new
6:14
my file that i just updated so here as
6:17
you can see since i have the proper
6:19
column names audio already
6:21
gives me the right uh the right fields
6:24
to choose from and always when you want
6:26
to import back again test if everything
6:29
works so making sure everything seems
6:31
valid audio says okay i'm just going to
6:33
import it again
6:36
so what happens here is uh let's check
6:39
out for example our account
6:41
for my cars if i go back here you see
6:44
that it has updated the name properly
6:46
and the code as well so it's super easy
6:49
uh
6:50
and it just takes me like
6:52
much less time to update it through an
6:54
input than through uh manually line by
6:57
line that's all for me in this video
6:59
thank you for watching ciao tutti
